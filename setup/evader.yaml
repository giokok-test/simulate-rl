evader:
  # Mass of the evader aircraft [kg]
  mass: 1500.0
  # Maximum acceleration magnitude the evader can command [m/s^2]
  max_acceleration: 15.0
  # Upper speed limit [m/s]
  top_speed: 100.0
  # Dimensionless coefficient modelling drag
  drag_coefficient: 0
  # How much information the evader gets about the pursuer
  #   1 - evader has no knowledge of the pursuer
  #   2 - only the distance to the pursuer is observed
  #   3 - evader receives the unit vector pointing to the pursuer
  #   4 - full pursuer position is known (values >4 behave the same)
  awareness_mode: 1
  # Maximum yaw rotation rate [deg/s]
  yaw_rate: 5
  # Maximum pitch rotation rate [deg/s]
  pitch_rate: 10
  # Maximum allowable pitch angle [deg]
  stall_angle: 75.0
  # Preset trajectory mode. Use "dive" to level off until the dive angle
  # threshold is reached
  trajectory: dive
  # Angle to the target at which the evader begins its dive [deg]
  dive_angle: 70.0
